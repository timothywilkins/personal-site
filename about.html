          Hello! My name is Tim and I would like to thank you for visiting my portfolio site. I graduated from
          the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a degree in music
          composition and minors in Japanese, music technology and Asian studies. After graduating I moved to Japan to teach
          English in the JET program for three years. After that I spent six months in Colombia volunteering at an English institute while taking pictures with my newly-gained Canon T5i. Since then I've moved to the Twin Cities and am now looking for opportunities to grow and add to my skill set.
          <br><br>
          I am extremely passionate about the digital landscape. For me it is the culmination of the right and left sides of the brain, the creative and logical halves.

          My journey down this rabbit hole began when I got a Canon T5i and learned to take pictures while teaching English in Tunja, Colombia. As a musician I know the only way to get better at something is through practice, and I took countless pictures everyday, either by going for a two or three hour walk in the city or even taking pictures of innoculous objects in my room.
          <br><br>
          Below are some of the many skills that I have experience in, all of which I would like to put to work for you:
