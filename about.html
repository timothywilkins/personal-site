          Hello! My name is Tim and I would like to thank you for visiting my static portfolio site. I graduated from
          the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a degree in music
          composition and minors in Japanese, music technology and Asian studies. After graduating I moved to <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottori_Prefecture" target="_blank">the good</a> life in Japan to teach
          English in the JET program for three years. After that and a little bit of travel I have now settled in the
          Twin Cities.
          <br><br>
          I like to think I have a lot to offer from many different fields. I have a perspective and understanding on
          things that is different.
          <br><br>
